# Street Wars Inc - Proto Files

SWI is made as a spiritual successor to the original Street Wars Online 2, from 2000, and was created as a means to learn about GO and protobufs.

Also see the [SWI Server](https://github.com/MrEliasen/SWI-server) and the [SWI Client](https://github.com/MrEliasen/SWI-client) 

### Setup/Install

Run `npm install`, that is it.

### Build/Compile

Run `npm run generate`, it will spit out the Go proto files in the `go` directory and the TS files in the `ts` directory.
Copy these files to the server and client respectively.
